# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      **TESTED URL:** https://nomination-mgmt.preview.emergentagent.com/program/f60eb66e-3956-428d-8060-181ceeb498f8
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: DAY HEADERS NOT VISIBLE
      • Day headers exist in DOM (4 headers found: Dag 1-4)
      • Headers have correct text content and dates (e.g., "Dag 1, lördag 14 mars 2026")
      • Text color is white (rgb(255, 255, 255)) ✓
      • BUT: Background gradient is NOT rendering!
      • Background shows as transparent (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)) instead of dark green gradient
      • Root Cause: Custom Tailwind classes 'from-haggai' and 'to-haggai-dark' are not integrated into Tailwind's gradient system
      • The classes bg-haggai (#15564e) and bg-haggai-dark (#0f403a) are defined as CSS utilities but NOT in Tailwind's color palette
      • This prevents gradient utilities (from-{color}, to-{color}) from working
      
      ✅ SESSION COLORS - ALL WORKING CORRECTLY:
      • Blue background (rgba(191, 219, 254, 0.6)) for Atheism (3), Goals (4), Leadership (4) ✓
      • Orange background (rgba(254, 215, 170, 0.6)) for Mandate (3), Stewardship (4) ✓
      • Green background (rgba(187, 247, 208, 0.6)) for Next Gen (3) ✓
      • Purple background (rgba(243, 232, 255, 0.5)) for Evaluation (7) ✓
      • White background (rgb(255, 255, 255)) for Breaks (17) ✓
      
      ✅ PRINT BUTTON - WORKING:
      • Button exists and is visible: "🖨️ Skriv ut program" ✓
      • Button is clickable and functional ✓
      
      📊 SUMMARY:
      • Total sessions tested: 46
      • All session colors match requirements perfectly
      • Print functionality working
      • Day headers INVISIBLE due to gradient not rendering
      
      🔧 FIX REQUIRED:
      Add haggai colors to Tailwind config's color palette in tailwind.config.js:
      ```
      colors: {
        haggai: {
          DEFAULT: '#15564e',
          dark: '#0f403a',
          light: '#1a6b61'
        }
      }
      ```
      This will enable gradient utilities to work: from-haggai to-haggai-dark

      🔍 TESTING COMPLETED: "Dela nomineringslänk" (Share Nomination Link) Functionality
      
      ✅ WORKING FEATURES:
      • Login with password "Haggai2030" - WORKING PERFECTLY
      • Navigation to /admin/workshops - WORKING PERFECTLY
      • Found 5 workshops with share buttons - WORKING
      • "Dela nomineringslänk" button visible and clickable - WORKING
      • QR Dialog opens when button clicked - WORKING
      • QR code is visible in dialog - WORKING
      • Nomination link format is correct: {url}/nominera/{workshopId} - WORKING
      • "Ladda ner QR-kod" button exists - WORKING
      
      ❌ CRITICAL BUG FOUND:
      • "Kopiera länk" button inside QR dialog has a bug (Line 879 in AdminWorkshops.jsx)
      • Current code: onClick={() => copyNominationLink(qrWorkshop.id)}
      • Issue: Function expects workshop object but receives only ID
      • Result: Link copied is "https://nomination-mgmt.preview.emergentagent.com/nominera/undefined"
      • Expected: "https://nomination-mgmt.preview.emergentagent.com/nominera/{workshopId}"
      
      🔧 FIX REQUIRED:
      Change line 879 from:
        onClick={() => copyNominationLink(qrWorkshop.id)}
      To:
        onClick={() => copyNominationLink(qrWorkshop)}
      
      ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (NOT CRITICAL):
      • Two console warnings about missing Description for DialogContent (accessibility)
      • Toast shows "Kunde inte kopiera länken" in automated test (clipboard API limitation in headless browser)
      
      📝 NOTE: The main "Dela nomineringslänk" button (line 569) works correctly because it passes the whole workshop object. Only the copy button inside the QR dialog has this bug.
