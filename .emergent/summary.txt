The basic file and routing for a new Donations page have been created.

- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** After implementation, use the screenshot tool to verify the new page's UI and layout.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:

- **Task 1:**
    - **Where to resume:**
        1.  Open .

    - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Tasks:**

  - **Dynamic Leader Experience Programs (P2):** The Leader Experience programs are still loaded from a mock file (). This could be migrated to a database collection with its own admin panel for full dynamic control.
