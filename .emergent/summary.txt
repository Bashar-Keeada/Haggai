<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a multi-page website for Haggai Sweden. The project has evolved to include a full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Structure:** Multi-page website with password protection.
- **Pages:** Home, About Us, Haggai Leader Experience, Event Calendar, Membership, Contact, Partners, a members-only area, a Donations page, and multiple admin panels.
- **Admin Panels:** Manage Leaders, Board Members, form submissions, organization members, partners, testimonials, and now also Nominations and Workshops.
- **Features:**
    - **Dual Password System:** A main site password and a members-only area password. A new, separate login system for board members has also been added.
    - **Dynamic Content:** Content for Leaders, Board, Testimonials, Partners, Programs, Nominations, Board Meetings, and Workshops is managed dynamically.
    - **Donations Page:** A page for one-time or regular gifts via Swish or bank transfer.
    - **Internationalization:** The site supports Swedish, English, and Arabic.
    - **Nomination System:** Members can nominate individuals for workshops/training via the Event Calendar. These nominations are manageable in an admin panel and trigger email notifications.
    - **Board Meeting System:** A private system in the members' area for scheduling, managing agendas, and documenting board meetings. It includes authentication for board members.
    - **Workshop/Price Management:** Update training to workshop across the site and allow an admin to manage workshop details, including adjusting the price.

**User's preferred language**: Swedish. The next agent MUST respond in Swedish.

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive full-stack application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. All previously requested features are implemented, including a donations page, a full nomination system with email notifications via Resend, and an authenticated board meeting management system within the members' area. The agent has just begun implementing a system to manage workshops (formerly trainings) and their prices. Backend APIs and a new admin page () have been created, and initial workshop data has been seeded into the database. However, the new admin page is currently failing to display the seeded workshops.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Debugging the new Admin Workshops page (). The page currently shows Inga workshops hittades (No workshops found) even though the initial workshop data has been successfully seeded into the database via a backend endpoint. The agent suspects the frontend API call is not correctly fetching all workshops.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (but it revealed the bug)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by  and frontend logs.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Workshops not displaying on Admin Page (P0)**

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
    - **Description:** The  page fetches data from the  endpoint but fails to display the workshops that were seeded into the database. The page shows an empty state.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent created the page and the backend endpoint, and successfully seeded the data. The bug was discovered during verification. The agent theorized that the  parameter in the GET request might be the issue.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1. Verify the exact API call being made from . Check the browser's network tab or frontend logs to see the full request URL and parameters.
        2. Test the  endpoint directly with  using the same parameters to see if the backend returns the expected data.
        3. Examine the backend code for the  function in  to ensure the logic for filtering workshops (e.g., by ) is correct.
        4. Check the frontend code in  to ensure the response data is being correctly parsed and mapped to the UI components.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this will make the workshop management feature functional, allowing the admin to view and edit workshop details and prices as requested.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** N
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Workshop & Price Management (P0)**

**Task Detail:**
- **Task 1:**
    - **Where to resume:** Resume by debugging the  page as outlined in Issue 1. Once the workshops are displayed, ensure the price editing functionality works and the term utbildning is replaced with workshop in all relevant public-facing pages (like  and ).
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The user's request to manage workshops and their prices will be fully implemented.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    - **Blocked on something:** Blocked by Issue 1.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **Email notifications for other forms (P2):** Implement Resend email notifications for new submissions from the contact, membership, or leader experience application forms.
  - **Email reminders for Board Meetings (P2):** Implement a scheduled or manual trigger to send email reminders to board members before a scheduled meeting. The backend endpoint for this already exists.
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **Dynamic Leader Experience Programs (P2):** The Leader Experience programs are still loaded from . This should be migrated to the new  database collection.
  - **PDF Export for Board Meetings (P3):** Add functionality to export meeting agendas and minutes as a PDF file.
  - **Online Payment Integration (P3):** Integrate a payment provider like Stripe to handle online donations or workshop fees.

- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:**
    - Site-wide password protection (simple context-based).
    - Board member login with JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing.

- : Contains the new API endpoints for workshops.
- : Will need to be updated to fetch workshop data from the backend instead of .
- : Will need to be updated to fetch workshop data.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  and  pages still use data from . They should be refactored to fetch data from the new  endpoint to complete the dynamic data migration.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You must respond in Swedish.**
- The immediate priority is to fix the bug on the  page where seeded data is not being displayed.
- The user has provided an email () for one board member, but others are missing emails. The admin panel for board members should be used to add emails before their accounts can be used.
- The Resend integration is live but relies on the user-provided API key in  and the verified  domain.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- : Created and updated throughout the session.
