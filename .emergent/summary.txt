**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. The site is multi-lingual (SV, EN, AR with RTL support) and fully protected by a simple password login ().

Key implemented features include:
- A Leader Experience page with dynamically loaded programs from the backend.
- A Leaders page displaying facilitators, managed via an admin panel.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The user requested a system to manage the board of directors, including profiles with images, an admin panel to add new members, and an archive for past boards. The agent began by defining the backend model and API endpoints and creating the frontend admin page file.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** First, use the backend testing agent to verify the new API endpoints. Then, use the frontend testing agent to test the new admin UI and the updated members' area.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The current work is a feature implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete the Board Member Management System (P0)**

**Task Detail:**
- **Task 1:**
    - **Where to resume:**
        1.  **Backend:** Finalize the CRUD API endpoints for board members in . The  model and basic routes have been added, but the logic needs completion (create, read, update for archiving, list active/archived).
        2.  **Frontend (Admin):** Build out the UI in . This page should allow an admin to add new board members (with name, title, year, image URL), view the current board, and move members to an archive (e.g., by setting an  flag).
        3.  **Frontend (Public):** Modify . Replace the hardcoded list of board members with a  call to the new  endpoint. Implement the UI to show the current board and a button/accordion to view Previous Boards from the archive.
        4.  **Routing:** Add a link to the new Admin Board page in a logical place, such as the main Admin Dashboard () or the settings (gear icon) dropdown menu.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The site will have a dynamic system for managing the board of directors, fulfilling the user's request for profiles, an admin interface, and an archive of past members.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
